# 2026-02-16 — Daily Notes

## Session with Kamil

- Asked about reading telegram convo history — can't scroll back, only see live messages
- Asked about supabase — not installed, openclaw uses SQLite + sqlite-vec
- Asked about the tech stack — Node.js, TypeScript, SQLite
- Built convo-watcher.sh to export session messages to JSON
- Running as background process (PID 1383, 30s interval)
- Script lives outside the git repo so can't commit/push from workspace
- Added test memory entries (this file + MEMORY.md)
