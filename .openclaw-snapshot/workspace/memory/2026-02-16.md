## Session Notes

- [context] First real session as Kai. Previous agent "Nano" had promised memory system setup but nothing was persisted.
- [action] Set up memory system from scratch — MEMORY.md + daily log structure
- [decision] Using manual file reads for memory until embeddings API key is configured
- [lesson] Always verify work actually exists on disk. Promises ≠ delivery.
- [context] Kamil asked about what I need to function — clarified that skills depend on openclaw repo, gateway binary doesn't
