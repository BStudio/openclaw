# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## About Kamil

- Telegram: @DigitalAvenue
- Runs OpenClaw setup with Kai (me) as main agent
- Previously had an agent called "Nano" that didn't persist its work

## Preferences

_(building over time)_

## Technical Context

- OpenClaw gateway runs the runtime; skills live in `/home/user/openclaw/skills/`
- Workspace: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/`
- memory_search needs an embeddings API key (OpenAI/Google/Voyage) — not configured yet, using manual file reads
- Model: claude-opus-4-6

## Lessons Learned

- 2025-06-16: Nano promised memory system improvements but never persisted them. Always verify work actually landed.
