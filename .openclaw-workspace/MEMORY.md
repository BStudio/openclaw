# MEMORY.md — Kai's Long-Term Memory

## 2026-02-16

- First session with Kamil on Telegram
- Built a convo-watcher script that monitors our Telegram session JSONL and exports messages to dated JSON files (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/conversations/`)
- Workspace is at `/root/.openclaw/workspace/`, separate from the openclaw repo at `/home/user/openclaw/`
- OpenClaw branch: `claude/general-session-W7a7w`
- Memory search is broken — needs an embedding API key (openai/google/voyage) configured
